Install Visual Studio Extension
===============================

⏲️ 5 minutes

First step for using SpecFlow is installing the Visual Studio extension.

It  provides several helpful features, such as syntax highlighting for Gherkin (feature) files, a Visual Studio project template, and multiple item templates, which help you create executable specifications with SpecFlow. 

To install the extension, download the extension for your version of Visual Studio:

![Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TechTalkSpecFlowTeam.SpecFlowForVisualStudio)
![Visual Studio 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TechTalkSpecFlowTeam.SpecFlowforVisualStudio2017)

If you are using an older version of Visual Studio, you have to upgrade to the supported versions.

After installing the extension, you should see it in the "Managed Extensions" dialog of Visual Studio.
