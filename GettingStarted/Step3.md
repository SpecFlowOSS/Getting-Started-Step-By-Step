***> Note:** Do **NOT** use any special characters in your project name e.g. (parenthesis)*. This will result in build errors from the code generated by SpecFlow.

**4-** On this next screen you can configure the Test Framework (Runner) you want to use. We suggest using the free SpecFlow+ Runner but you may choose a different Runner if you a have particular preference. Hit ***Create*** once you have made your selection.

You should see the new SpecFlow project in the Solution Explorer as per below:
