Create calculator project
=========================

‚è≤Ô∏è 10 minutes

In this step you'll create the application that will be tested, also called System Under Test (SUT).
The application will be a simple calculator in a C# class library.

**1-** Open JetBrains Rider and create a new C# class library by selecting "New Solution" from the startup dialog:

![Jet Brains Startup Dialog](../_static/riderimages/newsolution.png)

**2-** Select "Class library" and use the below configurations and click ***Create***.

- Solution & Project name: SpecFlowCalculator

- Solution directory: **choose a location to save the project* - in this example the solution is saved to `C:\projects`

- Language: C#

- Framework: netcoreapp3.1
  
![Create Class Library](../_static/riderimages/classlibrary.png)

**3-** Rename `Class1.cs` to `Calculator.cs` and overwrite the content with the following code :

``` csharp
using System;

namespace SpecFlowCalculator
{
    public class Calculator
    {
        public int FirstNumber { get; set; }
        public int SecondNumber { get; set; }

        public int Add()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
    }
}

```

![calculator sut](../_static/riderimages/sut.png)

**4-** Now build the solution by navigating to "Build ‚û° Build Solution". You should see a "Build Succeeded" message in the output window:

![calculator sut](../_static/riderimages/buildsuccess.png)

üìÑ The calculator application is now built. In the next step you'll learn how to create a SpecFlow project.
