Welcome to the Step-By-Step Getting Started Guide!
==================================================
**Before you start**

This guide is aimed at more technical users who are familiar with Visual Studio and/or JetBrains Rider and have a **basic understanding of C#**. 

The SpecFlow extension works with **Visual Studio 2017 or later** and **JetBrains Rider 2020.3.1 or later**.
Depending on which guide you chose to follow, you must have one of these IDEs installed on your machine.

If you donâ€™t fall into the category of users mentioned above then we recommend you to `learn more about SpecFlow <https://go.specflow.org/a1h>`_ 
before pairing up with a more technical person and continuing this guide.

**What will you learn in this Guide?**

The guide will take you through the process of setting up your first SpecFlow project and 
automate a simple Gherkin specification against a sample application.

*Estimated total time: 60 minutes

**What is not part of this guide?**

If you like to use additional automation libraries that can be used together with SpecFlow (e.g. Selenium for UI automation), you can check the `Bookshop example <https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow/en/latest/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-With-An-Example.html>`_  or the `Selenium example <https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow/en/latest/ui-automation/Selenium-with-Page-Object-Pattern.html>`_.
