Welcome to the Step-By-Step Getting Started Guide!
==================================================
**Before you start**

This guide is aimed at more technical users who are familiar with Visual Studio and have a basic understanding of C#. 
You must also have Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later installed on your machine before you start this guide.

If you donâ€™t fall into the category of users mentioned above then we recommend you to `learn more about SpecFlow <https://specflow.org/what-is-specflow/>`_ 
before pairing up with a more technical person and continuing this guide.

**What will you learn in this Guide?**

The guide will take you through the process of setting up your first SpecFlow project and 
automate a simple Gherkin specification against a sample application.

*Estimated total time: 60 minutes 

**What is not part of this guide?**

If you like to use additional automation libraries that can be used together with SpecFlow (e.g. Selenium for UI automation), you can check the `Bookshop example Intro <https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow/en/latest/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-With-An-Example.html>`_ .

**Do you need any further help?**

`Join our next onboarding webinar <https://specflow.org/events/>`_ to help you get started with SpecFlow.

You can also get help by reaching out to our support team `here <https://go.specflow.org/nfg>`_.
